Hi, I'm Jessica! I'm interested in bioinformatics, microbiology, and data management.

My PhD focused on Cyanobacteria living in ice-covered lakes in Antarctica. I generated new genomes from microbial mats and studied how they can survive in harsh conditions. I also analyzed the biogeography of these genomes by finding them in existing public metagenomes from around the globe.

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar with the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem. I run trainings and hackathons and provide product support for the [CFDE metadata catalog portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/).

My research interests are on microbial communities and the detection of organisms within metagenomic data sets.
