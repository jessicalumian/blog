I taught a small, research-focused course at UC Davis called BIS23B. The goal of the course 
was to introduce students to bioinformatics analyses and research techniques.

The course was part of a two-part series of [Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience](https://fys.ucdavis.edu/cures)
 (CURE) classes. These the goal of CURE classes are to emphasize research skills while learning. In the
first course of the series, students learned about halophilic bacteria and archea and spent time
in the lab isolating them. At the end of the course, the isolated organisms were sent off for sequencing.

In the course that I taught, students learned fundamentals of bioinformatics analysis and how to
work with sequencing data. In the second half of the course, students created pursued their own
bioinformatics research projects pertaining to halophilic organisms.

My contributions to this course included:

- Preparing course material to teach bioinformatics concepts (DNA read quality, assembly, annotation) and computational skills in R
- Guiding students through laboratory sessions to work through provided material and open ended challenges
- Supporting students through independent research projects

As a result of this course, three novel salt-tolerant organisms were discovered. The draft genome assemblies are
being announcement in a Genome Announcement that is currently in preparation for publication.
