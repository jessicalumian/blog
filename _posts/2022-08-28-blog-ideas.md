I have a few ideas for blog posts that I would like to write up.

- Transferring large datasets between HPCs using globus endpoints
- Isolating a slow-growing benthic cyanobacteria from a microbial mat sample (and avoiding contamination from faster growing eukaryotes)
- Comparing overlapping k-mers between genomes and metagenomes. How can you tell if a small amount of shared DNA is from the same organism or from shared plasmids?

The first two ideas are ready to write up, but the last is waiting on some analysis.

More to come soon!
