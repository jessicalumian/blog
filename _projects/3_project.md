During the last year of my PhD, I was a Policy Fellow at the Governor's Office of Planning a Research with the 
[California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine](https://opr.ca.gov/ciapm/).

During this time, I created an interactive Asset Inventory of precision medicine entities throughout California.
I was given an excel spreadsheet with information about the assets and I used SQL and ArcGIS to create an interactive
map.

Next, I used ESRI ArcGIS ExperienceBuilder to build an application viewable on computers, tablets, and phones. This 
involved implementing filtering options as well as a free text search. In order to determine what features were important for the application, I sought feedback from precision medicine stakeholders.

Finally, I created surveys to allow additional groups to add or edit entries to the Asset Inventory. Although it is 
possible to allow ArcGIS maps to be edited by anyone, I chose to require manual review before allowing changes to 
the map.
