Before I started graduated school, I worked as a Bioinformatics Training Coordinator the the Lab for 
[Data Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/). During this year I coordinated:

- 30+ half day  workshops
- 10+ two day workshops
- 10+ weeks of intensive workshops

Most workshops were beginner to intermediate levels with some specialized advanced sessions as well.

Topics included:

- **Bioinformatics Workflow Skills**: genomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics analyses
- **Computational Skills**: Python, R, data visualization
- **Cloud Compute Tools**: Amazon Web Services, Jupyter Notebooks

I frequently acted as a helper during these workshops to assist with questions or software installation
problems.

I also organized a series of online workshops. Although these are now common, they weren't as popular back
in 2016!

During this year, I also participated in instructing and helping Software Carpenty bioinformatics workshops.

I wanted to apply my newfound bioinformatics skills, so I worked with a group to generate the first Tule Elk genome, which 
was used to track Tule Elk populations based on single nucleotide variations.
