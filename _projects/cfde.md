I have two main responsibilities as a Postdoctoral Scholar with the National Institutes of Health Common Fund Data Ecosystem: working on 
the portal website and organizing trainings.

The CFDE portal is a metadata catalog of data from 11 Common Fund groups. Instead of going to 11 separate online portals
to search for data, a biomedical researcher can search for data across groups in one place! For example, all of the kidney
sequencing data can be identified in a single search.

My role for the CFDE portal is to provide input on development, test new features, and facilitate the data submission
process. This work involves communicating across many different disciplines and using creative problem solving skills.

In addition to portal contributions, I organized two online hackathons with over 80 participants each and assisted
with online trainings. As part of the week-long hackathons, I gave a webinar on the CFDE portal.
