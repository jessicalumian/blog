I was the Course Coordinator for the six week Microbial Diversity Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. My responsibilities for this time included:

- Coordinating class schedules for instructors, students, and guest lecturers
- Managing laboratory needs and ordering supplies
- Planning events and excursions

A fantastic benefit of my position was the ability to participate in the course. I learned a lot from lecture
series and used a variety of lab equipment both at the bench and in the field. Most importantly, this course 
sparked my curiosity in microscopic organisms and the diversity of life.

I learned basic microbiology lab skills: preparing plates, growing organisms, and microscopy. I also gained a healthy appreciation 
for the level of "try a bunch of things and see what sticks" when culturing and isolating organisms. Different microbes will
grow in different conditions!

The most impactful takeaway from this experience was an appreciation of the vast diversity of microbial life, and a desire
to study and understand a tiny slice of life. This pushed me towards the topic of my PhD dissertation: understanding how 
Antarctic cyanobacteria survive in extreme conditions.
